# SC1015-mini-project
# Background+Table of content
In this mini project, we will be predicting happiness indexes of all the different regions in the world.

In our repository,
1. Datasets for happiness index from 2017-2021
2. Jupyter notebook code containing EDA and ML
3. Presentation slides

# Problem definition
Whether the variables determining the happiness index (ladder score) of the highest ranked region, can be used to det ermine the happiness index of other regions.


# EDA process
1.Dropping of unnecessary columns
2.Renaming columns to combine data
3.Checking of NULL values
4.Skewness of Data

# Updated problem statement after EDA
Whether the variables of GDP Per Capita, Freedom to make life choices and Perceptions of Corruption for Western Europe can be used to determine the happiness index of other regions


# Tools used for Machine Learning
1.Univariate Linear Regression
2.Random Forest
3.XGBoost

# Solution Pathway
1.Training and testing all three models on Western Europe data set for all three variables.
2.Determining the best model to tell on all other regions.
3.Analysing accuracy of predictions.

# Conclusion
For models that give a more accurate prediction, they are mostly regions with a higher number of developed countries
Factors affecting happiness level in developed countries is different from that of developing countries, hence we cannot generalise the variables to predict happiness index

# What we learned
1. Random Forest regression
2. XGBoost regression
3. Application of lab knowledge to this real life project
